Search Google, retrieve results, get keyword positions for your domain.

## Usage
An example of use is given in `example.php`.

Consider using proxies if you're planning to make a lot of requests, because later on Google asks for human verification, but if you spread your requests through several proxies - it's all OK. 

The format for proxy is `IP:PORT`, for ex. `149.202.56.98:8888`.

You can find elite proxies for testing here: http://www.google-proxy.net/
